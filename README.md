# odin-recipes2
This is my first project in the TOP Program.

This project is a basic recipe website.

In this project I will be putting my HTML knowledge to the test and practice what I have learend thus far.

As I move along in this program, I will be modifying this recipe website to include styles (CSS) of code to make it unique.
